# Mac startup sound patcher

This is a set of utilities that can patch the startup sound inside of various official Apple firmware update files.

Currently, the following machines are supported:

- [Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White)](g3_blue_and_white/) - PowerMac1,1
- [iMac (Original)](imac_original/) - iMac,1
- [iMac (Slot Loading)](imac_slot_loading/) - PowerMac2,1

See the README in each individual chime patcher for more info about the patching process for that model.
